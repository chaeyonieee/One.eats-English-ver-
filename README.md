According to statistics, the number of single-person households has exceeded 7 million last year, and the trend is continuously increasing over the past 5 years. It is expected that the number of single-person households will continue to grow in the future. <br><br>
Additionally, according to the Ministry of Environment, 70% of food waste comes from households and small restaurants, and the amount of uneaten food waste reaches 30%, leading to serious environmental pollution annually. <br><br>
Lastly, compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of single-person households dining out at least once a week has increased by 40%, and households that cook at home have decreased by 20%, resulting in an increase in the ratio of delivery and takeaway food for single-person households. <br><br>
<br>
The causes of these phenomena were analyzed as follows:<br>
<br>
1. The existing supermarket delivery services are designed for a minimum of two people, making them too expensive and providing too much food for single-person households. <br>
To improve this, we aimed to diversify the product quantities available and reduce prices by directly shipping "ugly" produce. <br>
We also prepared a hot deal page for cheaper shopping options and a community where users can freely share recipes. <br><br>
2. Organic produce is expensive, causing financial strain. <br>
While people are aware that organic produce is beneficial, the high prices can be burdensome. <br>
To address this, we aimed to sell "ugly" produce. By contracting directly with farmers and avoiding middlemen, we can sell products at more than 20% cheaper than market prices, helping to reduce food expenses. <br>
